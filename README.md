A cross-platform MRuby port of the core system libraries from CRuby.

API Documentation
-----------------

[api.md](/api.md) lists all of the supported classes & methods. The interfaces match, as closely as possible, those of CRuby.

At a glance
-----------

- IO (read, write, pipe, popen)
- File, FileTest, File::Stat
- Dir
- BasicSocket, UDPSocket, TCPSocket, TCPServer
- ENV[], ENV[]=, & ENV.delete
- Kernel ( \`backticks\`, system, spawn, & load)
- Process (spawn & wait)
- Process::Status (including the global $?)
- Forwardable
- Observer
- OpenStruct
- Shellwords

Building
--------

### Mac and Linux

**1. Setup the dependencies**
- Download libapr version 1.5.2 from [Apache's website](https://apr.apache.org/download.cgi)
- Download `mruby-apr` [here](https://github.com/jbreeden/mruby-apr).
- Add `conf.gem 'path/to/mruby-apr'` to your MRuby's `build_config.rb` file.

**2. Make & Rake**
```
cd /path/to/apr
configure && make && sudo make install
cd /path/to/mruby
rake
```

### Windows

**1. Setup the dependencies**
- Download libapr version 1.5.2 from [Apache's website](https://apr.apache.org/download.cgi)
- Download `mruby-apr` [here](https://github.com/jbreeden/mruby-apr).
- Add the following lines to your MRuby build_config.rb file.
```Ruby
ENV['APR_HOME'] = "/path/to/your/libapr/build/dir"
conf.gem '/path/to/mruby-apr'
```
*Notice that on windows, you must set APR_HOME to tell this gem where to find headers & lib files*

**2. CMake & Rake**

APR comes with `cmake` scripts. You can use `cmake` to generate different kinds of project files for building APR.
To name a few, Visual Studio, MinGW, and NMake are supported. Just use the same compiler you're using for MRuby.

Once APR is built

```
cd /path/to/mruby
rake
```

Platform Support
----------------

Primary development and testing done on Windows, Mac, Ubuntu, and Raspbian. However, it should work anywhere you can compile [Apache APR](https://apr.apache.org).

Implementation Details
----------------------

Apache APR provides a cross platform runtime library for C, allowing portable access to system resources
(eg processes, files, sockets, etc.). `mruby-apr` provides bindings to this library to bring these capabilities
to mruby, without having to code the cross-platform logic over again.

These bindings are provided at 2 distinct levels:

1. Direct bindings to libapr are provided in the `APR` module.
  + These bindings provide a nearly identical api to libapr from mruby as is available in C.
  + The main point of difference is that out-parameters in the C API correspond to multiple return values in the mruby API.
2. The direct bindings are used to implement portions of the CRuby standard library, purely in mruby.
  + This provides a familiar and idiomatic API to system resources for ruby programmers.
  + As with the Rubinius implementation, this should make it easier for Ruby programmers to hack on the stdlib.
